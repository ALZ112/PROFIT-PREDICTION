# PROFIT-PREDICTION
Develop a startup profit prediction system using regression models: linear, polynomial, decision tree, and random forest. Evaluate models using R2, MAE, and MSE metrics. Deploy the best-performing model. Find the code, dataset, and documentation on the GitHub repository for replication and collaboration.


\# Startup Profit Prediction

This project aims to predict the profit of startups using regression models. It leverages multiple regression techniques, including linear regression, polynomial regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression. The objective is to compare the performance of these models and identify the best-performing one.

## Project Overview

- Implement regression models to predict startup profit.
- Evaluate models using R2 score, MAE, and MSE metrics.
- Deploy the best-performing model for profit prediction.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about various startups, including R&D spend, marketing spend, administration costs, and location. The target variable is the profit.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install dependencies:
3. Run models and evaluate performance:
4. Compare models using R2 score, MAE, and MSE to determine the best one.
5. Deploy the best-performing model:
